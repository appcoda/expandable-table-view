# Expandable UITableView in iOS with Swift

A common feature of almost all apps is the fact that they provide multiple view controllers to users to navigate and work with. Those view controllers can be used in many ways, such as to simply display some kind of information on-screen, or to gather complex data from user input. Creating new view controllers for different functionalities of an app is often mandatory, and several times a little bit daunting task. However, sometimes it's possible to avoid creating new view controllers (and their respective scenes in storyboard) if you just make use of **expandable tableviews**.
